# Welcome to the First Perceval Quest!

Your challenge is to tackle the well-known MNIST problem using a hybrid quantum model on a subset of the original dataset.

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 handwritten digit images, each 28x28 pixels. For this quest, you'll work with a reduced dataset of 6,000 images and use a quantum kernel to predict the digits.

The dataset is located in the `data` folder, containing `train.csv` and `test.csv` files. The notebook `MNIST_classification_quantum.ipynb` provides code for building quantum embeddings and integrating them into a basic classical model.

## Challenge Rules

Use any classical machine learning model and demonstrate improved performance with the quantum kernel (see Evaluation Criteria).
Submit your solution as a reproducible Jupyter notebook.
Modify the provided quantum kernel as needed.
## Challenge Structure

The challenge consists of two phases:

### Phase 1 
Participants submit an initial solution using the provided quantum kernel logic. The top 10 solutions will advance to Phase 2 based on:

- Accuracy improvements
- Creativity in approach
- Report quality

Selected participants will receive credits for Scaleway GPU simulators to develop extended solutions in Phase 2.

### Phase 2 
Qualified participants will develop and submit enhanced solutions using the quantum kernel logic.

## How to Participate

Email perceval-challenge@quandela.com with your team description (individual or group entries welcome). You'll receive confirmation and submission instructions.

## Submission Requirements

Your submission must include:
1. Complete code
2. A brief report covering:
   - Classical model description
   - Quantum kernel implementation
